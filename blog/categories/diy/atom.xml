    <content type="html"><![CDATA[After four years of use, the wire on my MagSafe finally fray out. After searching a bit, I found that a new one costs $80!!
My old memories came back: almost all accessories by Apple are rip-offs. See how low the ratings are:

<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HbwCGT5IRfg/Un22iAWR3FI/AAAAAAAA6S8/kb8A295sneA/s800/Apple%252085W%2520MagSafe%2520Power%2520Adapter%2520%2528for%252015-%2520and%252017-inch%2520MacBook%2520Pro%2529%2520-%2520Apple%2520Store%2520%2528U.S.%2529.png">

I know that this can be easily fixed if you know a little soldering and have courage: the adapter is working perfectly fine, it is just the wires.
I decided to DIY. There are several pretty good articles on how to [open the MagSafe][open] and how to [solder it][solder].

The following are my workflows. The first step is to open it. You can see there are two wires, in fact in my case only the black wire is broken.
I don't even need to solder.

Okay, go ahead and twist them. Use insulating tapes to wrap them tight.

Finally, reassemble it and use more tapes, since the outside layer is cut out. More importantly, strong taping help to protect another fray.

It looks a bit odd though, since the Apple product is supposed to be WHITE.
Here's how I fix it. I don't have good tools available, so I just use whatever
I have. I recalled that I have some Google stickers, and I just cut the white
pieces out.

After more taping, it looks like better now. Maybe I should consider wrapping better things outside later.

Hooray! Now it is working again! In fact, I am amazed that this piece of gadget has been working for four years, daily. It is still working just fine :)

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[I did not realize until my car's radio's broken that, with less than a hundred bucks, you can buy a new Head Unit with nearly all functionality. Some note-worthy features include:

- iPod/iPhone support. Control the iphone directly from the panel.
- App support. This includes I-heart-radio, pandora, etc.
- Bluetooth Audio: stream music directly from a paired device. Even supports Pandora!
- Upgraded FM/AM support. Displays text from radio stations.

Since I never used CD, I actually decided to buy a Digital Media Receiver: [JVC KD-X250BT](http://www.crutchfield.com/S-kT2jsjodqXG/p_105KDX250B/JVC-KD-X250BT.html). Since every car has a different wiring harness, we need to buy a compatible wiring harness. My car has a Double DIN design but the DMR is a single DIN one, so I actually need to buy a installation kit. The wiring setup is fun:

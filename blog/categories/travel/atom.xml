    <content type="html"><![CDATA[In this year, I did several crazy road trips, each trip has about 3k miles. Here're them.

# Winter Trip
The first trip is a trip with my parents, where they flied to Chicago and I drove them to UIUC for a visit.
We then flied to LA and rented a car to start our road trip. The whole trip was mainly in California, though
we drove a bit east and visited Las Vegas and Grand canyon.

I drove from Champaign all the way to Mountain View, with most of the part of [Route 66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_66).

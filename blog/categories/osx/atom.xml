One of the neat things you can do in OS X is to reveal a file in Finder.app from
some other applications. Turns out lots of the time, we also want to do that in
the terminal. The following script helps you with that:

<!-- more -->

``` applescript reveal
#!/usr/bin/osascript
on run args
	set fullpath to do shell script "realpath " & (quoted form of first item of args)
	set theFile to POSIX file fullpath
	tell application "Finder"
		reveal theFile
		activate
	end tell
end
```

Note:

1. You should put this into a directory in your search path. I recommend in
`~/bin`. Also remember to `chmod +x`.
2. The above requires another script `realpath`, which returns the
fullpath of a file. You can find it
[here](/blog/2014/05/01/os-x-get-full-path-of-file-using-realpath/).]]></content>

/Applications/iBooks.app

```

`realpath` is a command line utility that is 
included in most UNIX distributions but not Mac OS X.
Thanks to [Stuart Campbell](https://github.com/harto),
a minimal implementation is provided 
[here](https://github.com/harto/realpath-osx), and my 
[fork](https://github.com/iveney/realpath-osx).

<!-- more -->

If you use `homebrew`, you can tap my 
[repo](https://github.com/iveney/homebrew-mocha), and install it using
homebrew.

``` bash
brew tap iveney/mocha
brew install realpath
```

Viola! Now you can get the full path of file in console. A nice thing
I often use is to chain it with `pbcopy` to copy the full path to 
the OS X clipboard.]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[I found that Safari in Mavericks is not using local `proxy.pac` at all.
Turns out because of sandboxing, it will not allow reading file from local.
A traditional solution is to turn on **Web Sharing**, and thus use HTTP to read the pac file such as `http://localhost/proxy.pac`.

However, this cannot be done that simple, since Apple removed Web Sharing from normal version of Mavericks. To turn on the web service (Apache), do this:

```
sudo apachectl start
```

Also, place the pac file under `/Library/WebServer/Documents`, which is the default Document Root of Apache.

Tom Fischer proposed [another way](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3202499?start=30&tstart=0) to get around, however I don't think it a good idea to mess around the system files.]]></content>

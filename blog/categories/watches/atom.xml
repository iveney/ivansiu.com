I've been looking around entry-level watches for some time. Recently,
I answered a [question](http://www.zhihu.com/question/29695310/answer/45929205?group_id=577053538367111168) 
in Zhihu (Chinese Quora), and I feel like to transcribe this collection in my blog.

## Dress Watch

![Rodina R005, $119 via Amazon](https://res.cloudinary.com/maomao/image/upload/v1491291930/blog/watches/rodina.jpg)

This watch is discussed in my previous [blog post](/blog/2015/03/26/watch-review-rodina-r005gb/).
It is a bit debatable as some people think it completely
ripoff the NOMOS Tangente. However, considering there so many Rolex Submariner
homages, this should also considered a homage. It uses a Seagull ST1701 movement,
sapphire crystal, and display case back. At this price point, it is really
a good deal. Get in on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VLY2106/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00VLY2106&linkCode=as2&tag=zigxia-20&linkId=3ZTM75JFDBHOIEIK).

![Orient Bambino, $130 via Amazon](https://res.cloudinary.com/maomao/image/upload/v1491291930/blog/watches/orient_bambino.png)

I've always like the ORIENT logo, much more than SEIKO's. This watch features
Roman literals, blue hands and white classic dial. [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MVPB7UO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00MVPB7UO&linkCode=as2&tag=zigxia-20&linkId=MGHKNNXNNVCQ5GOO)

![Daniel Wellington, $120 Men](https://res.cloudinary.com/maomao/image/upload/v1491291930/blog/watches/DW_men.jpg) ![$85 Women](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3315210/blog/watches/DW_women.jpg)

This has been quite popular in China, due to their successful marketing campaign.
It is a quartz (Japanese) watch with multiple variation, and looks really good.
Get the best looking ones [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BKQT5RC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00BKQT5RC&linkCode=as2&tag=zigxia-20&linkId=K2IGKVEEO7YTRQ6T) and [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D19B4DE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00D19B4DE&linkCode=as2&tag=zigxia-20&linkId=2AHHERE54PC7HT5A).

## Diver's Watch

Now moves to my favorite category. Rolex designed the true classic look
of today's diver's watch. However, the retail price for a submariner is probably
too high for lots of people. Fortunately, Japanese brands SEIKO and ORIENT
provide some affordable options here.

![SEIKO skx007](https://res.cloudinary.com/maomao/image/upload/v1491291930/blog/watches/seiko_skx007.jpg)

A very popular one. Considered as a poor man's Rolex. You can get it around 
\$180 at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5OD4I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000B5OD4I&linkCode=as2&tag=zigxia-20&linkId=TWJOKBR4I6MCBOXS).

![Orient Ray](https://res.cloudinary.com/maomao/image/upload/v1491291930/blog/watches/orient_ray.jpg)

Also a very popular one. As I said, I really like Orient's LOGO. I find it 
far more interesting to see the lions and shields rather than just the word
"SEIKO". \$130 at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A6U2EWQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00A6U2EWQ&linkCode=as2&tag=zigxia-20&linkId=GTWCDGRCTEYGW7QY).

![Orient Mako](https://res.cloudinary.com/maomao/image/upload/v1491291930/blog/watches/orient_mako.png)

Ray's brother, Mako. The watch face is slightly different, thinner hands, arabic
numbers at 6, 9 and 12 o'clock. Also around \$130 at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EWEQ3A/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001EWEQ3A&linkCode=as2&tag=zigxia-20&linkId=H37LB2B5KGLJ5NMQ).

## Field/Flight/Pilot Watch

![Seiko SNZG13](https://res.cloudinary.com/maomao/image/upload/v1491291930/blog/watches/seiko_snzg13.jpg) ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3315210/blog/watches/seiko_snzg13_lume.jpg)

One of my favorite. It's lume is fantastic and got countless compliments. Only \$100 at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006BUE84M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B006BUE84M&linkCode=as2&tag=zigxia-20&linkId=MA3O42A4RNTDGIY6).

![Orient FER2A001B0 Pilot Watch](https://res.cloudinary.com/maomao/image/upload/v1491291930/blog/watches/orient_pilot.jpg) ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3315210/blog/watches/orient_pilot_lume.jpg)

This is my favorite style. Look at the beautifully designed digits! It's lume
is also awesome: lumes at all numbers! When it's on sale you can [get it at \$125](http://amzn.to/1GCsWQG).

![SEIKO SNK 809](https://res.cloudinary.com/maomao/image/upload/v1491291930/blog/watches/seiko_snk809.jpg)

Bestseller in Amazon. Come with various colors
([black](http://amzn.to/1HY92E4), 
[green](http://amzn.to/1EVJrMP), 
[blue](http://amzn.to/1bJZXCj),
[beige](http://amzn.to/1GCtCpo)). 
It's so cheap (\$50) that people are getting all colors and rotate everyday.
Also, since it's so affordable, it will become your workhorse. You won't
treat it like million dollar watch that only put in your locker.

## Skeleton Watch

![Seagull M182SK](https://res.cloudinary.com/maomao/image/upload/v1491291930/blog/watches/seagull_m182SK.jpg)

Quite popular in watchuseek forum. Very nice seagull movement with a 
complete see-through design. That said, it might be too busy to see the hands.
\$135 at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KCJZ0TA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00KCJZ0TA&linkCode=as2&tag=zigxia-20&linkId=QUCGQW7E3HYSEZH4).

![Fossil Grant](https://res.cloudinary.com/maomao/image/upload/v1491291930/blog/watches/fossil_grant.jpg)

This skeleton is cleaner than the Seagull's. Nevertheless, Seagull is more
reputable than Fossil in watch making. [Amazon](http://amzn.to/1HYa178).

## Conclusion

So there you have it. These watches are very affordable and have the great
quality that earn them reputation. You can see them in nearly every watch
forums. If you just started watch collecting, consider getting one of them.
Let me know if you have any other suggestions.

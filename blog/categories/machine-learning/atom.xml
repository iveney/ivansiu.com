    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Let $\data$ be a set of data generated from some distribution parameterized by
$\theta$. We want to *estimate* the unknown parameter $\theta$. What we can do?

Essentially, we want to find a most likely value of $\theta$ given $\data$,
that is $\arg \max P(\theta | \data)$. According to Bayes Rule, we have

$$
P(\theta \given \data) = \frac{P(\data \given \theta)P(\theta)}{P(\data)}
$$

and the terms have the following meanings:

- $P(\theta \given \data)$: Posterior
- $P(\data \given \theta)$: Likelihood
- $P(\theta)$: Prior
- $P(\data)$: Evidence

<!-- more -->

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

An easy way out is to use the MLE method.
We want to find a $\theta$ the *best explains* the data. 
That is, we maximize $P(\data \given \theta)$.
Denote such a value as $\hat{\theta}_{ML}$. We have 

$$
\hat{\theta}_{ML} = \argmax_\theta P(\data \given \theta) = 
\argmax_\theta P(\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N \given \theta )
$$

Note that the above $P$ is a joint distribution over the data.
We usually assume the observations are *independent*. Thus, we have

$$
P(\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N \given \theta ) = 
\prod_{i=1}^{N} P(\mathbf{x}_i \given \theta )
$$

We usually use logarithm to simplify the computation, as 
logarithm is monotonically increasing. Thus, we write:

$$
\mathcal{L}(\data \given \theta) = \sum_{i=1}^N \log P(\mathbf{x}_i \given \theta )
$$

Finally, we seek for the ML solution:

$$
\hat{\theta}_{ML} = \argmax_\theta \mathcal{L}(\data \given \theta)
$$

If we know the distribution $P$, we can usually solve the above by 
setting derivative of $\theta$ to 0 and solve for $\theta$, that is,

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0
$$

## Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)

In MAP, we maximize $P(\theta \given \data)$ directly. Denote the MAP hypothesis 
as $\hat{\theta}_{MAP}$, we have:

$$\begin{array}{rl}
\hat{\theta}_{MAP} = & \argmax_\theta P(\theta \given \data) \\\\
 = & \argmax_\theta \frac{P(\data \given \theta)P(\theta)}{P(\data)} \\\\
 = & \argmax_\theta P(\data \given \theta)P(\theta)
\end{array}$$

Note that the last step is due to the evidence (data) $\data$ is constant, and
thus can be omitted in $\argmax$.

At this step, we notice that the only difference between $\hat{\theta}_{ML}$ and
$\hat{\theta}_{MAP}$ is the prior term $P(\theta)$. Another way to interpret
is that we consider $MAP$ is more general than $MLE$, as if we assume all
the possible $\theta$ are equally probable a priori, e.g., they have the same
prior probability, or *uniform prior*, we can effectively remove $P(\theta)$
from the MAP formula, and it looks like exactly the same as MLE.

Finally, if the independent observation holds, again we can use logarithm and
expand $\hat{\theta}_{MAP}$ as:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\hat{\theta}_{MAP} = & \argmax_\theta L(\data \given \theta) \\\\
 = & \argmax_\theta \sum_{i=1}^{N} \log P(\mathbf{x}_i \given \theta ) + \log P(\theta)
\end{array}
$$

The extra prior term has the effect that we are essentially 'pulling' the
$\theta$ distribution towards prior value. This makes sense as we are 
putting our domain knowledge as *prior* and intuitively the estimation is
biased towards the *prior* value.

## Naive Bayes Classifier

Assume that we are given a set of data $\data$, where each example
$\mathbf{x_j}=(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$,  which can be viewed as *conjunctions of
attributes values*. $v_j \in V$ is the corresponding class value. Using MAP, we
can classify an example $\mathbf{x}$ as:

$$v_{MAP}=\argmax_{v_j\in V} P(v_j \given a_1, \ldots, a_n)$$

The problem is that it is hard to find a joint distribution for  $P(\mathbf{x}
\given \theta)$. If we use the data to estimate the distribution, we typically
don't have enough data for each attribute. In other words, the  data we have is
very sparse compared to the whole distribution space.

Naive bayes makes the assumption that each
attribute is *conditionally independent* given the target class $v_j$, that is,

$$P(a_1, \ldots, a_n \given v_j) = \prod_{i=1}^n P(a_i \given v_j)$$

which can be easily estimated from the data.
Thus, we have the following naive bayes classifier:

$$v_{NB} = \argmax_{v_j \in V} P(v_j) \prod_{i=1}^n P(a_i \given v_j)$$

Note that the learning of naive bayes simply involves in estimating
$P(a_i \given v_j)$ and $P(v_j)$ based on the frequencies in the training data.

Normally the conditional independence assumption does not hold, but naive bayes
performs well even if so. 
More importantly, **when conditional independence is satisfied, Naive Bayes corresponds to MAP classification.**

## Conclusion

MLE, MAP and Naive Bayes are all connected. While MLE and MAP are parameter
estimation methods that returns a single value of the paramter being estimated,
NB is a classifier that predicts the probability of the class that an example
belongs to. We also have the following insightes:

- Given the data, MLE considers the paramter to be a constant and estimates
a value that provide maximum support for the data.
- MLE does not allow us to 'inject' our beliefs about the likely values for the parameter (prior) in the estimation process.
- MAP allows the fact that the paramter can take values from a prior
(non-uniform) distribution that express our prior beliefs regarding the paramters.
- MAP returns paramter value where the probability is highest given data.
- Again, both MLE and MAP returns a single and specific value for the paramter.
By contrast, *bayesian estimation* computes the full posterior distribution
$P(\theta \given \data)$.


## Thoughts

After reading this [article], I have the following interpretation:

- The Maximum Likelihood approach can be roughly regarded as traditional "frequentist" thinking.
- The MAP approach is a direct applicatin of Bayes Theorem. Thus, it can be regarded as a "bayesian" way of thinking.

## Introduction

This is a follow up of the L1-minimization series. The previous two posts are:

1. [A Comparison of Least Square, L2-regularization and L1-regularization][L2 vs L1]
2. [Sparse Signal Reconstruction via L1-minimization][Sparse Signal 1D]
<!-- more -->

We have explored using L1-minimization technique to 
[recover a sparse signal][Sparse Signal 1D]. 
The example shows a 1D example. This post demonsrates  on a 2D example, where
the image is viewed as a signal. This makes sense as we can perform 2D Fourier
Transform in the image, where the basis are a combination of *horizontal* and
*vertical* waves. For a complete introduction to FFT on images, refer to 
[this tutorial][FFT 2D]. Notice that similar to 1D signal, we do not measure
the image directly in time domain, but we do it in the frequency domain.
Concretely, say $x$ is the 2D image collapsed to 1D, and $A \in \reals^{k\times n}$ 
is the measurement matrix, $b$ is the observation, we then have $Ax=b$. 
Usually we will require $k = n$ to obtain an exact solution for $x$ given $A$ 
and $b$. Now, if we use FFT and obtain the frequency coefficients as $\hat{x}$,
we can also perform similar measurements $\hat{A} \hat{x} = \hat{b}$,
and the requirement $k = n$ is the same. In other words, the required samples 
(the information) is *the same*. By using the inverse fourier transform,
we can convert $\hat{x}$ back to $x$. The only difference is that the measurement
$\hat{A}$ is taken in frequency (Fourier) domain. As we can see later, we can
utilize sparse information to reduce $k$.

## Image Gradients and Total Variation

We first introduct the concept of image gradients. For any 2D real image `I`, if
we think about each row as a signal, we can then view the 'difference' between
adjacent pixels as (horizontal) gradient `Gx(I)`, this makes sense since a
sharpe change denotes an edge. Similary, we can define the vertical gradient
`Gy(I)` for columns. Thus, we have

$$Gx(I) = \begin{cases}
I_{i+1, j} - I_{ij} & i < n \\\\ 0 & i = n
\end{cases}
\qquad
Gy(I) = \begin{cases}
I_{i, j+1} - I_{ij} & j < n \\\\ 0 & j = n
\end{cases}$$

where the image size is $n\times n$.

Collectively, the image gradient `G(I)` is defined as the
magnitude (2-norm) of both components:

$$G(I)_{ij} = \sqrt{(Gx(I)_{ij})^2 + (Gy(I)_{ij})^2}$$

The following shows `Gx`, `Gy` and `G` of the phantom image:

-----------------  -----------------  -----------------
  ![phantom_gx]\     ![phantom_gy]\     ![phantom_gI]\ 
    `Gx(I)`             `Gy(I)`             `G(I)`
-----------------  -----------------  -----------------

The *total variation* `TV(I)` of an image is just the sum of 
this discrete gradient at every point.

$$TV(I)= \norm{G(I)}_1 = \sum_{i,j} G(I)_{ij}$$

We notice that $TV(I)$ is just the *L1-norm* of $G(I)$,
which leads us to the following: if we have an image that is sparse in
its image gradients, we can exploit that and use our L1-minimization trick.

## Sparse Gradient Image Reconstruction

The ratio of non-zero elements in `Gx`, `Gy` and `G` of the phantom image
is `0.0711`, `0.0634` and `0.0769`, respectively. These ratios are really 
small - and we consider the gradient as *sparse*.

Let $F: \reals^{n\times n} \to \complex^{n\times n}$ be the FFT operator, 
and $F I$ be the Fourier transform taken on image I.
Define a set $\Omega$ as the $k$ two-dimensional frequencies chosen
according to some sampling pattern from the $n \times n$.
We further define $F_\Omega I: \reals^{n \times n} \to \complex^k$ as the 
$k$ observation taken from the fourier transform of image I.
We can then solve the following optimization problem to recover $I$:

$$\min_I \norm{F_\Omega I - b}^2_2$$

where $F_\Omega$ can be view as the measurement matrix, $b$ is the observation,
and we want to find $I$ such that the *reconstruction cost* (energy) is
minimized.  

However, the above does not quite work. As we can see in the following images,
the *L2-minimization* does a poor job, either for a random measurement or
a radial measurement [@candes2006robust] in Fourier domain.

--------------------  ---------------------  --------------------
  ![M rand]            ![phantom rand bp]     ![phantom rand tv]
 Random measurement     L2-minimization        L1-minimization
--------------------  ---------------------  --------------------

--------------------  ---------------------  --------------------
  ![M radial]          ![phantom_backproj]     ![phantom_tv]
 Radial measurement     L2-minimization       L1-minimization
--------------------  ---------------------  --------------------


To utilize the sparse information, we add a L1-regularization term 
to the above objective function, which yields the following:

$$(TV_1) \quad \min_I \norm{F_\Omega I - b}^2_2 + \lambda TV(I)$$

Without surprise, optimizing the above gives us a *perfect* reconstruction
of the original image. 
It is shown that if there exists a piecewise constant I with sufficiently 
few edges (i.e., $G(I)_{ij}$ is nonzero for only a small number of indices i, j), 
then $(TV_1)$ will recover I exactly.

A heavily commented code example is available in my [github repository][code].
Leave a comment if you have any question.

## Probing Further

Now, take a look at another example `cameraman`, which has the following
gradients (intensity rescaled using matlab's `imagesc`.

------------------  --------------------
  ![cameraman]       ![cameraman_grad]
    Cameraman             Gradient
------------------  --------------------

The following shows the reconstructions (left two are using random measurements,
right two are using radial measurements).

----------------------  ----------------------  -----------------  -----------------
 ![cameraman_rand_bp]    ![cameraman_rand_tv]    ![cameraman_bp]    ![cameraman_tv]
      Rand (L2)             Rand (L1)              Radial (L2)        Radial (L1)
----------------------  ----------------------  -----------------  -----------------

As we can see, the results are not as good. In fact, the non-zero ratio of its
gradient is 0.9928, which is not sparse at all. However, if we plot the histogram
of gradients, we will find that most of the gradient magnitudes are small:

![Gradient Histogram][camera_mag_hist]

In particular, most of them are smaller than 200, which means the number of
'changes' that are larger than 200 is small. In fact, the ratio of
gradient > 200 is only *0.0964*! Thus, there are two possible ways to 
discard these information and get a 'compressed' image that is
sparse in gradients:

1. Use mean-shift algorithm to segment the regions such that they have the
same color intensities. K-means or quantization should achieve a similar 
result, though might not as good as mean-shift.
2. Use image filtering to smooth the image, which can effectively average colors
and discard high frequency information.

*I'll leave these conjectures for furture implementation. For those
intereted, please try them yourself and let me know your results.
If you have any thoughts, do not hesitate to leave a comment.*

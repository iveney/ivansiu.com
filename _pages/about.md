Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Research Scientist at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/careers/) based in [San Francisco Bay Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area). Before that, I obtained my PhD degree from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I am passionate of leveraging machilne learning to build engaging, personalized products. For example:

- Buliding a personalized News Feed that always show you the most relevant contents from your friends and family.
- Suggesting interesting contents based on your favorite topics.
- Recommending interesting people that you might like to connect with.

I blog all kinds of things here, such as [software notes & productivity hacks](/categories/#software), [ML & algorithms](/categories/#machine-learning), [personal finance](/categories/#personal-finance) and [DIY stuff](/categories/#diy). I write both in English and Chinese. I also write about my hobbies such as [traveling](/gallery/travel/), [woodworking](/gallery/woodwork/) and [photography](/gallery/photography/).
